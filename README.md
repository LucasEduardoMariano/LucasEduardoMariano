### ðŸ§  About Me

Iâ€™m Lucas â€” a junior developer building my path in the tech world.  
After completing a web development course, Iâ€™ve been creating projects that combine **clean code** with **intuitive and aesthetic interfaces**.

I believe logic and beauty can (and should) go together.  
Clean, structured and always with style.
